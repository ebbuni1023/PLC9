2. Write test programs in C++, Java, and C to determine the scope of a variable declared in a
for statement. Specifically, the code must determine whether such a variable is visible after the body of
the for statement.

C++:
The result which is 48 is printed out. It means the inside of the variable is visible after the body of 
the for statement.

C:
The result which is 48 is printed out. It means the inside of the variable is visible after the body of 
the for statement.

java:
TestProgram.java:9: error: variable x might not have been initialized
            x += i;
            ^
TestProgram.java:12: error: variable x might not have been initialized
        System.out.println(x);
                           ^
-> I got errors in line 9 and 12 which is saying that varialbe x is not initialized.
It means the variable x declared inside for loop doesn't has scope outside the for loop so a variable is not visible after the
body of the for statement.
