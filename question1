1. Write a C function that includes the following sequence of statements:
x = 21;
int x;
x = 42;
Run the program and explain the results. Rewrite the same code in C++, and Java and compare the
results

Ans)
C:
Cfunction.c:4:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'x'
    x = 21;
    ^

C++:
Cfunction.cpp:6:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'x'
    x = 21;
    ^

Java:
Cfunction.java:3: error: cannot find symbol
        x = 21;
        ^
  symbol:   variable x

Since we didn't didn't declare x at each line so we got an error that they can't find identifier x for c, c++, java.
